# Project Progress

## Current Status

The project is now in a stable, consolidated state with a single installation approach, and a Homebrew formula has been created for easier distribution. GitHub Actions workflows have been fixed to automate version bumping and releases.

### What Works

- ✅ Installation script creates virtual environment and dependencies
- ✅ AppleScript handler application properly receives file open events
- ✅ Python script successfully extracts attachments from winmail.dat files
- ✅ Email body is extracted and opened with TextEdit.app
- ✅ File associations are set up automatically (if duti is available) or can be set manually
- ✅ The application works without triggering security warnings
- ✅ Homebrew formula enables one-command installation (`brew install py-winmail-opener`)
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow for automated versioning and release creation
- ✅ Enhanced GitHub Actions workflows for reliable Homebrew formula updates:
  - Multiple trigger events for the update-homebrew workflow
  - Direct workflow call from auto-release to update-homebrew
  - Improved error handling and verification steps
- ✅ Homebrew installation process respects sandboxed environment limitations
- ✅ Fixed "Failed to read Mach-O binary" errors in Homebrew formula:
  - Moved wrapper script to libexec/bin directory
  - Added skip_clean :all directive to completely disable binary validation
  - Created proper symlinks from bin to libexec/bin
  - Updated both the local Homebrew tap and remote repository
- ✅ Improved repository structure with Git submodules:
  - Added homebrew-winmail repository as a submodule
  - Enables synchronized changes between application and formula
  - Simplifies development workflow for formula changes

### Evolution of Project Approach

The project went through several iterations to find the most reliable and security-friendly approach for handling winmail.dat files:

1. **Initial Approach**: Basic Python script to extract winmail.dat contents
   - Works from command line but not integrated with macOS

2. **First Integration Attempt**: Created a shell script wrapper in an app bundle
   - Had issues with file path handling from macOS

3. **Multiple Fix Approaches**: Tried various methods to improve file association
   - Launch Agent approach (worked but triggered security warnings)
   - Duti approach for system-level file associations
   - Shell script improvements for better path handling
   - Modified Info.plist for better event handling

4. **Final Consolidated Approach**: Simple AppleScript application that:
   - Directly receives file open events from macOS
   - Calls a handler script that uses the Python virtual environment
   - Provides desktop notifications and logging
   - Avoids security issues by not using Launch Agents

### Development Decisions

- **Security vs. Reliability**: Chose to prioritize security-friendly approach that doesn't trigger antivirus warnings
- **Simplicity vs. Robustness**: Opted for a simpler solution that's easier to maintain
- **Installation Workflow**: Consolidated all installation steps into a single script
- **File Handling**: Used multiple detection methods to ensure reliable file path handling
- **CI/CD Infrastructure**: 
  - Fixed GitHub Actions workflow to handle version updates correctly by matching the exact string format used in source files
  - Created a complete CI/CD pipeline where code changes trigger version bumps and releases, which in turn trigger Homebrew formula updates
  - Added direct workflow call mechanism to ensure the update-homebrew workflow is triggered reliably
  - Enhanced formula updating with robust syntax validation and intelligent formula repair capabilities:
    - Precise pattern matching to avoid breaking the Ruby syntax
    - Auto-detection and repair of broken `assert_match` lines
    - Ruby syntax validation before committing changes
    - Fallback mechanisms to revert changes if validation fails
- **Homebrew Integration**:
  - Modified installation script to adapt to Homebrew's sandboxed environment
  - Implemented conditional code paths for Homebrew vs. direct installation
  - Removed operations that require elevated permissions when running via Homebrew

## Git Submodule Workflow

The project now uses a Git submodule to manage the Homebrew formula repository. This approach provides several advantages for development and maintenance:

### Submodule Setup

- The Homebrew formula repository is included as a submodule at `homebrew/`
- Initial clone with submodules: `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/jsbattig/py-winmail-opener.git`
- Update submodules after regular clone: `git submodule update --init --recursive`

### Working with Submodules

1. **Always pull changes first**:
   ```bash
   # Update main repository
   git pull
   
   # Update submodule to latest
   git submodule update --remote homebrew
   ```

2. **Making coordinated changes**:
   ```bash
   # 1. Navigate to submodule directory
   cd homebrew
   
   # 2. Make changes to formula
   # (edit py-winmail-opener.rb)
   
   # 3. Commit changes in submodule
   git add py-winmail-opener.rb
   git commit -m "Update formula for version X.Y.Z"
   git push
   
   # 4. Return to main repository and commit submodule update
   cd ..
   git add homebrew
   git commit -m "Update Homebrew formula submodule reference"
   git push
   ```

3. **Recommended workflow for releases**:
   - Update application code and version
   - Update formula in submodule to reflect new version
   - Commit and push both repositories
   - Tag the main repository for release

## Next Steps

- [ ] Add proper application icon to improve user experience
- [ ] Consider creating a package installer (.pkg) for easier distribution
- [ ] Add support for more attachment types
- [ ] Improve error handling for malformed winmail.dat files
- [ ] Monitor GitHub Actions workflows to verify that the direct workflow call reliably triggers Homebrew formula updates
- [ ] Continue refining CI/CD processes with additional self-healing capabilities
- [ ] Update GitHub Actions workflows to handle the submodule structure
