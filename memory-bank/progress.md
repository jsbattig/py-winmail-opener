# Project Progress

## Current Status

The project is now in a stable, consolidated state with a single installation approach, and a Homebrew formula has been created for easier distribution. GitHub Actions workflows have been fixed to automate version bumping and releases.

### What Works

- ✅ Installation script creates virtual environment and dependencies
- ✅ AppleScript handler application properly receives file open events
- ✅ Python script successfully extracts attachments from winmail.dat files
- ✅ Email body is extracted and opened with TextEdit.app
- ✅ File associations are set up automatically (if duti is available) or can be set manually
- ✅ The application works without triggering security warnings
- ✅ Homebrew formula enables one-command installation (`brew install py-winmail-opener`)
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow for automated versioning and release creation
- ✅ Automatic Homebrew formula updates on new releases via GitHub Actions

### Evolution of Project Approach

The project went through several iterations to find the most reliable and security-friendly approach for handling winmail.dat files:

1. **Initial Approach**: Basic Python script to extract winmail.dat contents
   - Works from command line but not integrated with macOS

2. **First Integration Attempt**: Created a shell script wrapper in an app bundle
   - Had issues with file path handling from macOS

3. **Multiple Fix Approaches**: Tried various methods to improve file association
   - Launch Agent approach (worked but triggered security warnings)
   - Duti approach for system-level file associations
   - Shell script improvements for better path handling
   - Modified Info.plist for better event handling

4. **Final Consolidated Approach**: Simple AppleScript application that:
   - Directly receives file open events from macOS
   - Calls a handler script that uses the Python virtual environment
   - Provides desktop notifications and logging
   - Avoids security issues by not using Launch Agents

### Development Decisions

- **Security vs. Reliability**: Chose to prioritize security-friendly approach that doesn't trigger antivirus warnings
- **Simplicity vs. Robustness**: Opted for a simpler solution that's easier to maintain
- **Installation Workflow**: Consolidated all installation steps into a single script
- **File Handling**: Used multiple detection methods to ensure reliable file path handling
- **CI/CD Infrastructure**: 
  - Fixed GitHub Actions workflow to handle version updates correctly by matching the exact string format used in source files
  - Created a complete CI/CD pipeline where code changes trigger version bumps and releases, which in turn trigger Homebrew formula updates
  - Enhanced formula updating with robust syntax validation and intelligent formula repair capabilities:
    - Precise pattern matching to avoid breaking the Ruby syntax
    - Auto-detection and repair of broken `assert_match` lines
    - Ruby syntax validation before committing changes
    - Fallback mechanisms to revert changes if validation fails

## Next Steps

- [ ] Add proper application icon to improve user experience
- [ ] Consider creating a package installer (.pkg) for easier distribution
- [ ] Add support for more attachment types
- [ ] Improve error handling for malformed winmail.dat files
- [ ] Monitor GitHub Actions workflows to ensure they work correctly for future releases
- [ ] Continue refining CI/CD processes with additional self-healing capabilities
- [ ] Document the Homebrew update process and formula structure for future maintenance
