# Active Context

**Current Work Focus:**

*   Creating a Homebrew package for easier distribution and installation.
*   Consolidating the installation and file association approaches into a single, security-friendly solution.
*   Streamlining the README and installation process.
*   Removing unnecessary files and approaches while maintaining the core functionality.

**Recent Changes:**

*   Created a Homebrew formula (`py-winmail-opener.rb`) for package distribution.
*   Added Homebrew installation instructions to the README.
*   Modified the `install.py` script to work in Homebrew mode with system Python.
*   Updated version to 1.0.0 for the first stable release.
*   Added `--version` flag to the CLI for easier version checking and Homebrew testing.
*   Completely rewrote the `install.py` script to integrate the security-friendly AppleScript approach.
*   Simplified the README file to focus on the consolidated installation process.
*   Fixed GitHub Actions workflows for automating releases and Homebrew formula updates:
    * Fixed auto-release workflow to properly handle version string formats
    * Fixed update-homebrew workflow to trigger on release publication
    * Enhanced formula updating with robust syntax validation and more precise pattern matching
*   Created a clean, consolidated installation process that:
    * Creates a virtual environment with necessary dependencies
    * Creates a simple AppleScript application that directly calls a handler script
    * Sets file associations using duti (if available) or macOS native methods
    * Avoids triggering security warnings from antivirus software
*   Experimented with various file association approaches to find the most reliable solution:
    * **AppleScript approach (chosen solution)** - Creates a lightweight AppleScript application that directly handles file open events and calls our Python script. This approach avoids security warnings while providing reliable file handling.
    * **Launch Agent approach** - Created a launch agent that ensures our handler is called. Effective but triggered security warnings.
    * **Duti approach** - Used the duti command-line tool to set system-level file associations.
    * **Info.plist modifications** - Added specific keys to the application bundle's Info.plist file to better handle Apple Events.
    * **Shell script improvements** - Enhanced the file path detection in the application's shell script.

**Next Steps:**

*   Consider adding a proper icon for the application bundle.
*   Add more comprehensive testing for different types of Winmail.dat files.
*   Consider automatic update checks or mechanisms.
*   Monitor GitHub Actions workflow to ensure the fixed auto-release process works correctly.

**Active Decisions and Considerations:**

*   Chose the AppleScript approach as it provides the best balance of reliability and security.
*   Prioritized avoiding antivirus warnings by not using Launch Agents.
*   Integrated file association setting directly into the install.py script.
*   Maintained backward compatibility with direct command-line usage.
*   Fixed GitHub Actions auto-release workflow to correctly handle version formatting in setup.py and winmail_opener.py.
*   Improved the update-homebrew workflow to trigger on release publication rather than on push to master, creating a proper CI/CD pipeline where releases automatically update the Homebrew formula.

**Learnings and Project Insights:**

*   macOS file associations are complex, especially for Python-based applications.
*   AppleScript provides a reliable bridge between macOS file events and command-line scripts.
*   Simple approaches often work better than complex ones for application integration.
*   Security software often flags Launch Agents as suspicious, even when used legitimately.
*   Duti is a powerful tool for setting file associations but may not be available on all systems.
*   The AppleScript approach provides the most natural macOS integration.
*   GitHub Actions workflows need to match the exact string format used in source files when performing version updates. In our case, the workflow was using single quotes in its search patterns while the actual files used double quotes.
*   Adding robust error handling and diagnostic output in CI workflows makes troubleshooting much easier.
*   Workflow trigger events should match the expected context for variables. For the Homebrew update workflow, using a release trigger ensures that tag and version information is available in the expected format.
*   When updating files with sed in CI/CD pipelines, pattern matches should be as specific as possible to avoid breaking syntax.
*   Always validate the output of automated file changes, especially when dealing with code in different languages (like Ruby in Homebrew formulas).
*   When modifying code in different languages (like Ruby formulas), it's critical to understand the complete syntax structure you're modifying. In our case, we needed to understand that `assert_match` in Ruby requires two parameters.
*   Implementing fallback strategies for automated processes provides resilience. Our final update-homebrew workflow can detect and repair broken assert_match lines or add them if missing.
